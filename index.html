    <h1 id="titolo" t>THE HISTORY OF HUMANITIES COMPUTING</h1>
    <h3>Susan Hockey</h3>
    <h2 class="altro-titolo">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
      Tracing the history of any interdisciplinary academic area of activity raises a number of basic questions. What should be the scope of the area? Is there overlap with related areas, which has impacted on the development of the activity? What has been the impact on other, perhaps more traditional, disciplines? Does a straightforward chronological account do justice to the development of the activity? Might there be digressions from this, which could lead us into hitherto unexplored avenues? Each of these questions could form the basis of an essay in itself but within the space and context available here, the approach taken is to present a chronological account which traces the development of humanities computing. Within this, the emphasis is on highlighting landmarks where significant intellectual progress has been made or where work done within humanities computing has been adopted, developed or drawn on substantially within other disciplines.
    </p>
    <p>
    It is not the place of this essay to define what is meant by humanities computing. The range of topics within this Companion indeed sends plenty of signals about this. Suffice it to say that we are concerned with the applications of computing to research and teaching within subjects that are loosely defined as "the humanities", or in British English "the arts." Applications involving textual sources have taken center stage within the development of humanities computing as defined by its major publications and thus it is inevitable that this essay concentrates on this area. Nor is it the place here to attempt to define "interdisciplinarity", but by its very nature, humanities computing has had to embrace "the two cultures", to bring the rigor and systematic unambiguous procedural methodologies characteristic of the sciences to address problems within the humanities that had hitherto been most often treated in a serendipitous fashion.
    </p>
    <h2 class="altro-titolo">Beginnings: 1949 to early 1970s</h2> 
      <p>
      Unlike many other interdisciplinary experiments, humanities computing has a very well-known beginning. In 1949, an Italian Jesuit priest, Father Roberto Busa, began what even to this day is a monumental task: to make an index verborum of all the words in the works of St Thomas Aquinas and related authors, totaling some 11 million words of medieval Latin. Father Busa imagined that a machine might be able to help him, and, having heard of computers, went to visit Thomas J. Watson at IBM in the United States in search of support (Busa 1980). Some assistance was forthcoming and Busa began his work. The entire texts were gradually transferred to punched cards and a concordance program written for the project. The intention was to produce printed volumes, of which the first was published in 1974 (Busa 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
      A purely mechanical concordance program, where words are alphabetized according to their graphic forms (sequences of letters), could have produced a result in much less time, but Busa would not be satisfied with this. He wanted to produce a "lemmatized" concordance where words are listed under their dictionary headings, not under their simple forms. His team attempted to write some computer software to deal with this and, eventually, the lemmatization of all 11 million words was completed in a semiautomatic way with human beings dealing with word forms that the program could not handle. Busa set very high standards for his work. His volumes are elegantly typeset and he would not compromise on any levels of scholarship in order to get the work done faster. He has continued to have a profound influence on humanities computing, with a vision and imagination that reach beyond the horizons of many of the current generation of practitioners who have been brought up with the Internet. A CD-ROM of the Aquinas material appeared in 1992 that incorporated some hypertextual features ("cum hypertextibus") (Busa 1992) and was accompanied by a user guide in Latin, English, and Italian. Father Busa himself was the first recipient of the Busa award in recognition of outstanding achievements in the application of information technology to humanistic research, and in his award lecture in Debrecen, Hungary, in 1998 he reflected on the potential of the World Wide Web to deliver multimedia scholarly material accompanied by sophisticated analysis tools (Busa 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
      By the 1960s, other researchers had begun to see the benefits of working with concordances. A series of four articles by Dolores Burton in the journal Computers and the Humanities in 1981–2 attempted to bring these together, beginning with a discussion of the 1950s (Burton 1981a, 1981b, 1981c, 1982). Some of these researchers were individual scholars whose interests concentrated on one set of texts or authors. In the UK, Roy Wisbey produced a series of indexes to Early Middle High German texts (Wisbey 1963). In the USA Stephen Parrish's concordances to the poems of Matthew Arnold and W B. Yeats introduced the series of concordances published by Cornell University Press (Parrish 1962). This period also saw the establishment of computing facilities in some major language academies in Europe, principally to assist with the compilation of dictionaries. Examples include the Trésor de la Langue Française (Gorcy 1983), which was established in Nancy to build up an archive of French literary material, and the Institute of Dutch Lexicology in Leiden (De Tollenaere 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
      Although much activity at this time was concentrated on the production of concordances as ends in themselves, one application of these tools began to take on a life of its own. The use of quantitative approaches to style and authorship studies predates computing. For example, Augustus de Morgan in a letter written in 1851 proposed a quantitative study of vocabulary as a means of investigating the authorship of the Pauline Epistles (Lord 1958) and T. C. Mendenhall, writing at the end of the nineteenth century, described his counting machine, whereby two ladies computed the number of words of two letters, three, and so on in Shakespeare, Marlowe, Bacon, and many other authors in an attempt to determine who wrote Shakespeare (Mendenhall 1901). But the advent of computers made it possible to record word frequencies in much greater numbers and much more accurately than any human being can. In 1963, a Scottish clergyman, Andrew Morton, published an article in a British newspaper claiming that, according to the computer, St Paul only wrote four of his epistles. Morton based his claim on word counts of common words in the Greek text, plus some elementary statistics. He continued to examine a variety of Greek texts producing more papers and books concentrating on an examination of the frequencies of common words (usually particles) and also on sentence lengths, although it can be argued that the punctuation which identifies sentences was added to the Greek texts by modern editors (Morton 1965; Morton and Winspear 1971).
      </p>
      <p>It is believed that the first use of computers in a disputed authorship study was carried out on the Junius Letters by Alvar Ellegard. Published in 1962, this study did not use a computer to make the word counts, but did use machine calculations which helped Ellegard get an overall picture of the vocabulary from hand counts (Ellegard 1962). What is probably the most influential computer-based authorship investigation was also carried out in the early 1960s. This was the study by Mosteller and Wallace of the Federalist Papers in an attempt to identify the authorship of the twelve disputed papers (Mosteller and Wallace 1964). With so much material by both authorship candidates on the same subject matter as the disputed papers, this study presented an ideal situation for comparative work. Mosteller and Wallace were primarily interested in the statistical methods they employed, but they were able to show that Madison was very likely to have been the author of the disputed papers. Their conclusions generally have been accepted, to the extent that the Federalist Papers have been used as a test for new methods of authorship discrimination (Holmes and Forsyth 1995; Tweedie et al. 1996).

      At this time much attention was paid to the limitations of the technology. Data to be analyzed were either texts or numbers. They were input laboriously by hand either on punched cards, with each card holding up to eighty characters or one line of text (uppercase letters only), or on paper tape, where lower-case letters were perhaps possible but which could not be read in any way at all by a human being. Father Busa has stories of truckloads of punched cards being transported from one center to another in Italy. All computing was carried out as batch processing, where the user could not see the results at all until printout appeared when the job had run. Character-set representation was soon recognized as a substantial problem and one that has only just begun to be solved now with the advent of Unicode, although not for every kind of humanities material. Various methods were devised to represent upper- and lower-case letters on punched cards, most often by inserting an asterisk or similar character before a true upper-case letter. Accents and other non-standard characters had to be treated in a similar way and non-Roman alphabets were represented entirely in transliteration.
      </p>
      <p>
      Most large-scale datasets were stored on magnetic tape, which can only be processed serially. It took about four minutes for a full-size tape to wind from one end to the other and so software was designed to minimize the amount of tape movement. Random access to data such as happens on a disk was not possible. Data had therefore to be stored in a serial fashion. This was not so problematic for textual data, but for historical material it could mean the simplification of data, which represented several aspects of one object (forming several tables in relational database technology), into a single linear stream. This in itself was enough to deter historians from embarking on computer-based projects.
      </p>
      <p>
      Representation problems extended far beyond specific characters. For concordance and retrieval programs there was a need to identify citations by their location within the text. The methods used by conventional document retrieval systems were inadequate because they tended to assume document structures similar to those of journal articles and were unable to cope with the structures found in poetry or drama, or in manuscript sources where the lineation is important. Various methods of defining document structures were proposed, but the most sophisticated one developed at this time was that used by the COCOA concordance program (Russell 1967). Modeled on a format developed by Paul Bratley for an Archive of Older Scottish texts (Hamilton-Smith 1971), COCOA enables the user to define a specification for the document structure which matches the particular set of documents. It also enables the markup of overlapping structures, making it possible, for example, to encode a citation system for a printed version in parallel with that for the manuscript source of the material. COCOA is also economical of file space, but is perhaps less readable for the human.
      </p>
      <p>
      The other widely used citation scheme was more dependent on punched card format. In this scheme, often called "fixed format", every line began with a coded sequence of characters giving citation information. Each unit within the citation was positioned in specific columns across the line, for example the title in columns 1–3, verse number in columns 5–6, and line number in columns 7–9. The entry of this information was speeded up by functions on the punched card machine, but the information also occupied more space within the computer file.
      </p>
      <p>
      The legacy of these citation schemes can still be found in electronic texts created some time ago. COCOA, particularly, was very influential and other schemes were derived from it. COCOA cannot easily handle the markup of small features within the content such as names, dates, and abbreviations, but its ability to deal with overlapping structures outstrips that of almost all modern markup schemes.
      </p>
      <p>
      This period also saw the first opportunities for those interested in humanities computing to get together to share ideas and problems. In 1964, IBM organized a conference at Yorktown Heights. The subsequent publication, Literary Data Processing Conference Proceedings, edited by Jess Bessinger and Stephen Parrish (1965), almost reads like something from twenty or so years later, except for the reliance on punched cards for input. Papers discuss complex questions in encoding manuscript material and also in automated sorting for concordances where both variant spellings and the lack of lemmatization are noted as serious impediments.
      </p>
      <p>
      As far as can be ascertained, the Yorktown Heights conference was a one-off event. The first of a regular series of conferences on literary and linguistic computing and the precursor of what became the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing/Association for Computers and the Humanities (ALLC/ACH) conferences was organized by Roy Wisbey and Michael Farringdon at the University of Cambridge in March, 1970. This was a truly international event with good representation from both sides of the Atlantic as well as from Australia. The proceedings, meticulously edited by Wisbey (1971), set the standard for subsequent publications. A glance through them indicates the emphasis of interest on input, output, and programming as well as lexicography, textual editing, language teaching, and stylistics. Even at this time the need for a methodology for archiving and maintaining electronic texts was fully recognized.
      </p>
      <p>
      Another indication of an embryonic subject area is the founding of a new journal. Computers and the Humanities began publication in 1966 under the editorship of Joseph Raben. With characteristic energy, Raben nurtured the new journal and during its first years, at least until the regular series of conferences and associations that developed from them got going, it became the main vehicle for dissemination of information about humanities computing. Raben recognized the need just to know what is going on and the journal's Directory of Scholars Active was the first point of call for people who were thinking about starting a project. Other informal newsletters also served specific communities, notably Calculi for computers and classics, edited by Stephen Waite.
      </p>
      <p>
      The 1960s also saw the establishment of some centers dedicated to the use of computers in the humanities. Wisbey founded the Centre for Literary and Linguistic Computing in Cambridge in 1963 as support for his work with Early Middle High German Texts. In Tübingen, Wilhelm Ott established a group which began to develop the suite of programs for text analysis, particularly for the production of critical editions. The TuStep software modules are in use to this day and set very high standards of scholarship in dealing with all phases from data entry and collation to the production of complex print volumes.
      </p>
      <p>
      Work in this early period is often characterized as being hampered by technology, where technology is taken to mean character sets, input/output devices and the slow turnaround of batch processing systems. However, researchers did find ways of dealing with some of these problems, albeit in a cumbersome way. What is more characteristic is that key problems which they identified are still with us, notably the need to look at "words" beyond the level of the graphic string, and to deal effectively with variant spellings, multiple manuscripts, and lemmatization.
